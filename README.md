# 🌴 Hero Parallax Responsive Website

A fun **frontend experiment** where I explored the **3D parallax effect using only HTML & CSS**, applying it to a **blog-style website** inspired by my Goa exploration trip.

This project focuses on depth, layering, and smooth visual storytelling using the **z-axis** — no JavaScript parallax libraries involved.

## ✨ About the Project

This project was created purely as a **learning + fun experiment** when I was exploring how the **CSS `perspective` and `transform: translateZ()`** properties work.

To make it more interesting, I designed it like a **travel blog**, capturing calm jungle and beach vibes inspired by Goa 🌊🌿.

## 🌀 Parallax Effect Explained

The hero section uses a **3D parallax technique** by:

- Applying `perspective` to the parent container
- Placing multiple background layers at different **z-depths**
- Scaling layers based on their `translateZ()` values
- Creating a natural depth illusion while scrolling

This approach gives a smooth and immersive visual experience **without JavaScript**, relying purely on **CSS transforms and stacking**.
